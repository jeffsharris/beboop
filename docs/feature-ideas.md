# Feature Ideas (Lynden)

## Notes
- Target age: ~3 months, limited sitting, high-contrast visuals, simple cause/effect, short interactions.
- Default to gentle audio and low visual intensity; avoid strobing or rapid flashes.
- Keep gestures simple: tap, hold, shake, tilt, swipe.

## Enhancements to Current Sound Tiles
1) Coos Remix
- What: Add 1-tap variants: echo, gentle pitch shift, and slow/fast playback presets.
- Why: Immediate cause/effect with familiar sounds.
- Sensors: microphone, speaker.

2) Sound-Linked Color Pulse
- What: While a recording plays, the tile background softly pulses with amplitude.
- Why: Links audio to visual motion for tracking.
- Sensors: speaker, simple audio metering.

3) Long-Press Lullaby Loop
- What: Long-press a tile to blend the recording into a low-volume loop with slow fade in/out.
- Why: Soothing repeatable experience.
- Sensors: speaker.

4) Parent Palette

- Why: Tailor to what she tracks best.
- Sensors: none.

## New Visual-First Experiences
5) High-Contrast Mobile
- What: Slow-moving black/white shapes that drift and rotate; tap to change pattern.
- Why: Supports visual tracking at this age.
- Sensors: touch.

6) Glow Orb (Tap and Hold)
- What: A single large orb that grows brighter and larger as you hold, then slowly fades.
- Why: Simple cause/effect and calming motion.
- Sensors: touch.

7) Bubble Pop Garden
- What: Large, slow bubbles float up; tap to pop with soft sound and tiny ripple.
- Why: Simple interaction with clear feedback.
- Sensors: touch, speaker.

8) Peekaboo Screen
- What: Tap to reveal a face or bright shape; tap again to hide with a soft "peekaboo" sound.
- Why: Early object permanence play.
- Sensors: touch, speaker.

## Motion and Orientation Toys
9) Tilt Marble
- What: A single bright dot rolls with gravity; it chimes when it reaches corners.
- Why: Movement tracking and cause/effect with gentle motion.
- Sensors: accelerometer/gyroscope, speaker.

10) Shake Rattle
- What: Shake the phone to trigger soft rattle sounds and a brief color flash.
- Why: Physical movement to response mapping.
- Sensors: accelerometer, speaker.

## Sound-Reactive Experiences
11) Voice Fireflies
- What: The microphone drives a few glowing dots that brighten and drift with coos.
- Why: Encourages vocal play with visual feedback.
- Sensors: microphone, speaker (optional).

12) Rhythm Mirror
- What: A minimal waveform that expands with sound input and settles to calm breathing pace.
- Why: Visualizes her sounds in a soothing way.
- Sensors: microphone.

## Haptic + Calm Modes
13) Gentle Pulse
- What: A slow haptic heartbeat synchronized with a dim breathing gradient.
- Why: Soothing tactile rhythm when holding the phone.
- Sensors: haptics.

14) Night Mode Lullaby
- What: A low-light screen with slow color gradients and optional white noise.
- Why: Calm, low-stimulus environment.
- Sensors: speaker.
